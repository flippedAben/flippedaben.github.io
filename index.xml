      <description>This post is about activities I do where it is natural to think of engaging muscles to achieve some end result. The other perspective is relaxing the muscles you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of it like that, until recently. For this to make sense, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide some context. Here is a timeline of events in which this idea popped up.
Timeline A single MMA class When I was to college, I went to a single training session hosted by the MMA club.</description>

      <description>Intro I started the Wim Hof method on May 25, 2020. I did the cold showers and breathing exercises almost everyday. I did take a few days off due to sickness. I practiced meditation on and off.
Cons  You have to do it nearly everyday. Cold showers are uncomfortable at first. Breathing exercise is exercise, so you still have to put in the effort.  Pros  Breathing exercise feels great.</description>

      <description>Context I watched a YouTube video about Destiny interviewing Dr. K. Near the end, Destiny asks Alok: what is the number one tip he would give to someone who wants to be more mentally healthy. The tip is to know yourself. Quoting Alok:
 Understand yourself in the same way your try to understand external things.
 I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought about it this way. The way I try to understand anything externally is through the scientific method (usually).</description>

      <description>Honesty
My brother crashed at my place for two to three months to finish an internship in Austin. Today, he left. On the way back home, from the airport, I could feel what every writer describes as the precursor to crying. Part of it is the throat swelling. Part of it is the eye closing.
I want to understand myself more, so I tried my best to be honest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to put on a tough act.</description>

      <title>Meta Nihilism</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the meaningless of everything. The universe is inherently pointless. I think philosophers like to call it nihilism. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people say that although it is a depressing thought, it is actually very uplifting. The main idea is that you get to create the meaning to your life. This is as liberating as it gets.
I read some Reddit comment a while back. I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing here:
 The next logical leap is to ask what nihilism says about nihilism.</description>
